# Simple Contact Form using HTML, CSS, Google Apps Script & Google Sheets

> Sometimes, the most powerful tools are also the simplest.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how simple tools can be combined to solve real-world problems — without relying on complex frameworks or deployments.

I built a **custom contact form** using only:

- 🔹 **HTML & CSS** – for frontend layout & design  
- 🔹 **Google Apps Script** – as a backend processor  
- 🔹 **Google Sheets** – as a lightweight database  

What began as a simple experiment in minimalism turned into something surprisingly effective.
